# Week 1 - Assignment 2

1. Simplify the following symbolic statements as much as you can, leaving your
   answer in the standard symbolic form. (In case you are not familiar with the
   notation, I’ll answer the first one for you.)

   a. (π > 0) ∧ (π < 10)  : 0 < π < 10
   b. (p ≥ 7) ∧ (p < 12)   : 7 <= p < 12
   c. (x > 5) ∧ (x < 7)     : 5 < x < 7
   d. (x < 4) ∧ (x < 6)     : x < 4
   e. (y < 4) ∧ (y² < 9)   : x < 3
   f. (x ≥ 0) ∧ (x ≤ 0)     : x = 0

2. Express each of your simplified statements from question 1 in natural
   English.

   a. zero is smaller than pi and pi is smaller than ten
   b. seven is smaller than or equal to p and p is smaller than twelve
   c. five is smaller than x and x is smaller than seven
   d. x is smaller than four
   e. x is smaller than three
   f. x equals zero.

3. What strategy would you adopt to show that the conjunction 
   φ1 ∧ φ2 ∧ . . . ∧ φn is true?

   Starting from φ1 I would verify that it is true, 
   continuing with the next φx
    if φx is false ⇒ conjunction is false
    if φx = φn and φx is true ⇒ conjunction is true
